```{r}

I want to create a graph with the information found in the Afghanistan.csv file.
```{r}
Afghanistan_2007 <- read_csv('Afghanistan_2007.csv')
```
For now, the intention is to make a graph with only "best", referring to best estimate of death count, and "date_start", referring to the day the event began/occurred.
```{r}
ggplot(Afghanistan_2007) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = date_start, y = best, color = 'red')) +
  xlab('Date event begun') +
  ylab('Best estimate of deaths') +
  ggtitle('Deaths in Afghanistan in 2007')

ggsave('Afghanistan_2007.png')
```
